    <h2>North End Style Pizza</h2>
    <p>
        This pizza recipe will bring the North End of Boston into your own home. This thin crust, oily pizza will be a
        family favorite for years to come.
    </p>
    <p>Although you can make this authentic Italian pizza dough recipe by hand, it is way easier to use a mixer. Fail
        proof, No tossing required! Honestly this is the real reason I got a Kitchen Aid mixer and a pizza stone, so we
        can make the best homemade pizza ever.
    </p>
    <p>
        After constantly trying new recipes and formulas, and after having gone to Italy in search of the perfect rustic
        authentic Italian pizza dough, I am even more confident that this is the best recipe out there. Beep-beep!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1.5 tsp instant dry yeast</li>
        <li>1.5 tsp sea salt</li>
        <li>2.25 cups COLD water</li>
        <li>1 tbs extra virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Favorite Toppings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Caramelized onions</li>
        <li>Arrabiata Sauce</li>
        <li>Heirloom Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Fresh Basil</li>
        <li>Thin Sliced Pepperoni</li>
        <li>Smoked Mozzarella Cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven as high as it will go for at least 45 minutes to one hour with the pizza stone already
            inside. (I baked at 525"F but check your pizza stone for max temperature).</li>
        <li>In the bowl of your kitchen aid and using the paddle attachment mix the flour, sea salt and yeast on low
            speed until all is incorporated then add the COLD water.
            5 cups all purpose (or 00 flour ),1.5 tsp instant dry yeast,1.5 tsp sea salt,2.25 cups COLD water</li>
        <li>Switch to the dough hook and mix together on low speed for 8 to 10 minutes. The dough should be smooth and
            sticky but should not stick to the sides of the bowl, only a little to the bottom.</li>
        <li><strong>NOTE</strong> - If the dough sticks to the sides sprinkle in a little more flour, if it is too dry
            then add a bit
            more water. This will vary every time you make it so keep extra flour handy.</li>
        <li>After the 8 minutes have passed remove the dough from the mixer and cut it into 6 pieces and form them into
            rounds. Place them on a lightly oiled cookie sheet and drizzle with 1 tbs or so of extra virgin olive oil.
            Cover with plastic wrap and allow to sit at room temperature and rise for 2 hours in a draft free area, I
            prefer the cold oven. ( At this stage you can also freeze the dough individually or place in the fridge
            overnight or a couple of days).
            1 tbs extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the counter with a little bit of flour, take one piece of dough and press down on it with your
            fingers until you have 1/2" thick circle or oval. Using your fists and knuckles start stretching the dough
            until 10" in diameter making sure not to tear it ( this should be easy since it is a small pie).
        </li>
        <li>Dust your pizza peel (or a piece of cardboard) very well with semolina flour or corn meal and set your pizza
            dough on it making sure it slides easily when moved. Pour 2-3 tablespoons of the pizza sauce in the center
            and spread it around with the back of a spoon leaving 1 inch of space at the edges and making sure not to
            get any on the peel. Sprinkle with the mozzarella and add your favorite toppings. ( Don't add too many
            toppings, keep in mind this is a thin crust and a couple of toppings will suffice ).
            Arrabiata Sauce
        </li>
        <li>Gently slide the pie on the preheated pizza stone in a hot 525"F degree or more oven, and bake for 5 to 7
            minutes or until golden brown on the edges. When making the breakfast pizza I find that the egg cooks
            perfectly in 6 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and sprinkle with the basil and freshly grated parmigiano reggianno. Allow to rest for
            a few minute for the cheese to set.
        </li>
    </ol>
